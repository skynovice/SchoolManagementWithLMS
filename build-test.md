# Build Test Results

## Changes Made to Fix Vercel Deployment

### 1. Fixed vercel.json Configuration
- **Removed**: `VERCEL_FORCE_NO_BUILD_CACHE` environment variable
- **Reason**: This was causing Vercel to look for prebuilt artifacts that don't exist
- **Result**: Vercel will now run the full build process

### 2. Added .vercelignore
- **Purpose**: Ensure Vercel doesn't use cached/old build artifacts
- **Contents**: Ignores .svelte-kit/, .vercel/, build/, and other cache directories

### 3. Current Configuration
- **Framework**: SvelteKit with adapter-auto
- **Node.js Version**: 20.x (specified in package.json and vercel.json)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Runtime**: nodejs20.x for all functions

### 4. Expected Deployment Flow
1. Vercel clones the repository
2. Runs `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Runs `npm run build` to build the application
4. adapter-auto detects Vercel environment and configures appropriately
5. Deploys with Node.js 20.x runtime

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these changes to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy
3. The build should now complete successfully

## Files Modified
- `vercel.json` - Removed problematic cache setting
- `.vercelignore` - Added to prevent cache conflicts
